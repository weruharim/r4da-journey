# Data Transformation
## Filtering data using `filter()` function in R
In my data analysis journey with R, I have learned how to use the `filter()` function to extract specific rows from a dataset based on certain conditions.

To begin, I loaded the necessary libraries, including the `tidyverse` and `nycflights13` packages. I also loaded the flights dataset from the `nycflights13` package to work with. This dataset contains information about flights that department New York in 2013.

To get a better understanding of the dataset, I used the `view()` function to see the entire flights data frame. Additionally, I explored the documentation for the `flights` dataset using the `?flights` command.

To filter the data and extract specific flights, I utilized the `filter()` function. For example, I filtered the flights dataset to extract flights that occurred on January 1st by specifying the conditions `month == 1` and `day == 1`. I stored the filtered data in a new data frame called `jan1`.
```R
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
view(jan1)
```

To view the `jan1` data frame, I used the `view()` function again. Alternatively, I could print the new data frame by enclosing the assignment in parentheses, like this:

```R
(jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1))
```

Next, I experimented with filtering the flights dataset using comparison operators. I filtered flights with a an early departure of more than or equal to 20 minutes by applying the condition `dep_delay <= -20`. Similarly, I filtered flights with an air time of 60 minutes or more using the condition `air_time >= 60`.

```R
depDelayed <- filter(flights, dep_delay <= -20)
view(depDelayed)

longFlights <- filter(flights, air_time >= 60)
view(longFlights)
```

I also explored the use of Boolean operators to filter data based on multiple conditions. For instance, I filtered flights that occurred in October, November, or December and covered a distance of over 1000 miles. I achieved this by combining the conditions `(month %in% c(10, 11, 12))` and `distance > 1000`.

```R
peakLongFlights0 <- filter(flights, (month == 10 | month == 11 | month == 12) & distance >= 1000)
view(peakLongFlights)

#A simplified code
peakLongFlights <- filter(flights, (month %in% c(10,11,12)) & distance > 1000) 
```

In addition to the examples above, I completed a series of exercises to further practice filtering data using the `filter()` function. These exercises involved filtering flights based on various criteria such as arrival delay, destination, operating airline, departure month, and more. For each exercise, I used the `filter()` function with the corresponding conditions and stored the filtered data in new data frames. To examine the results, I utilized the `view()` function to inspect each filtered data frame.

```R
#Exercises
#Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
longDelays <- filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
view(longDelays)

#Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
flightsToHouston <- filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
view(flightsToHouston)

#Were operated by United, American, or Delta
flightsOperated <- filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))
view(flightsOperated)

#Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
summerFlights <- filter(flights, month %in% c(7, 8, 9))
view(summerFlights)  

#Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
arrLateDepEarly <- filter(flights, arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay == 0)
view(arrLateDepEarly)

#Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
longDelayed <- filter(flights, dep_delay > 60 & air_time > 30)
view(longDelayed)

#Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
lateDep <- filter(flights, dep_time >= 2400 | dep_time <=6)
view(lateDep)
```

Throughout my learning process, I also discovered the usefulness of the `between()` helper function. I utilized this function to filter flights that occurred in the summer months (July, August, and September) and flights that departed between midnight and 6 am.

```R
#using between()
summerFlights1 <- filter(flights,  between(month, 7, 9))

lateDep1 <- filter(flights,  between(dep_time, 0, 6))
```

Lastly, I explored the concept of missing values and filtered flights that had a missing departure time using the `is.na()` function.

```R
#How many flights have a missing depature time?
missingDepTime <- filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
view(missingDepTime)
```

By applying the `filter()` function and exploring various conditions and operators, I gained a better understanding of how to extract specific subsets of data from a larger dataset.


## Arranging data using `arrange()` function in R

When working with the `arrange()` function, I learned how to sort the flights based on different criteria:

To arrange the flights from the least delayed in arrival to the most delayed, I used the `arrange()` function with the `arr_delay` column.

```R
arrangedByArrDel <- arrange(flights, arr_delay)
```

To sort the flights from the most delayed in arrival to the least delayed, I used the `arrange()` function with the `desc()` helper function applied to the `arr_delay` column.

```R
delayedFlights <- arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
view(delayedFlights)
```
I completed a series of exercises to further practice arranging data using the `arrange()` function. For the exercises, I explored different sorting scenarios using `arrange()`:

I sorted the flights to bring all missing values to the start by applying the `desc()` helper function to the `is.na(dep_time)` expression.

```R
missingDepTime <- arrange(flights, desc(is.na(dep_time)))
```

To find the most delayed flights, I sorted the flights in descending order based on the departure delay (`dep_delay`) and arrival delay (`arr_delay`) columns.

```R
delayedDepFlight <- arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))

delayedArrFlights <- arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```

I identified the flights that left earliest by arranging the flights based on the departure delay (`dep_delay`) column.

```R
earlyDepFlights <- arrange(flights, dep_delay)
```

For finding the fastest flights, I used the `arrange()` function with the `air_time` column.

```R
fastFlights <- arrange(flights, air_time)
```

To determine which flights traveled the longest and shortest distances, I sorted the flights in descending order based on the distance column for the longest flights, and in ascending order for the shortest flights.

```R
#Which flights traveled the longest?
longFlights <- arrange(flights, desc(distance))

#Which traveled the shortest?
shortFlights <- arrange(flights, distance)
```

## Selecting data with the `select()` function in R

While working with the `select()` function, I learned how to choose specific variables from the flights data frame:

I selected only the destination column by using the `select()` function with the `dest` variable.

To extract a range of variables, I utilized the `select()` function with the range specified using the `: operator`.

Excluding specific variables from the selection was achieved by using the `-(variable_name)` notation within the `select()` function.

By employing helper functions like `contains()`, `starts_with()`, and `ends_with()`, I could select variables based on specific patterns in their names.

I also discovered the `rename()` function (a variation of `select()`, which allowed me to rename variables within the flights data frame.

I also conducted some exercises to practice different selection scenarios using `select()`:

I brainstormed multiple ways to select the `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` variables from the flights data frame.

I explored the behavior of including the same variable multiple times in a `select()` call.

I learned about the `all_of()` and `any_of()` functions, which proved helpful when combined with a vector of variable names for selection.

I also experimented with the case sensitivity of select helpers and learned how to change the default behavior using the `ignore.case` argument within the helper functions.

## Adding calculated variables with `mutate()` in R
In this code snippet, various manipulations and analyses were performed on the flights dataset using the `mutate()` function in R. Let's go through the code and understand the steps taken.

First, a subset of the flights dataset called `flightsSml` was created by selecting specific columns, including year, month, day, variables ending with "delay", `distance`, and `air_time`.
```R
flightsSml <- select(
  flights,
  year:day,
  ends_with("delay"),
  distance,
  air_time
)
```
Then, I used the `mutate()` function to add two new variables to the `flightsSml` dataset. The first variable, `gain`, was calculated by subtracting the departure delay (`dep_delay`) from the arrival delay (`arr_delay`). The second variable, `speed`, was computed by dividing the `distance` by the `air_time` and multiplying by 60 to convert to minutes.
```R
mutate(flightsSml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance/ air_time * 60
)
````
I also learned that I can  refer to a variable I have created. I created a new dataset named calcFlightsSml using the `mutate()` function again. This time, additional variables were added, including `hours`, representing the `air_time` in minutes, and `gainPerHour`, representing the `gain` divided by the `air_time` in hours.

```R
calcFlightsSml <- mutate(flightsSml,
       gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
       hours = air_time * 60,
       gainPerHour = gain / hours
       )
```
I discovered that variables created using `mutate()` are not kept. The `transmute()` function can be used to keep them instead of keeping all the variable.


```R
transmute(flightsSml,
       gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
       speed = distance/ air_time * 60
)
```

I used modular arithmetic to breakdown time in hours and minutes and used `transmute()` to keep the variables and drop the others.

```R
transmute(
  flights,
  dep_hr = dep_time %/% 100,#dividing departure time by 100
  dep_min = dep_time %% 100 #storing the remainder of the above as minutes
)
```
I also learned to use `min_rank()` function to rank values in a vector. A vector x was created with numerical values, and min_rank() was used to rank the values in ascending order.

```R
x <- c(3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1)
min_rank(x)
````

I completed some exercises to test what I have learned. In the first exercise, I converted `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight:

```R
flights <- mutate(flights,
                  dep_time_min = dep_time %/% 100 * 60 + dep_time %% 100,
                  sched_dep_time_min = sched_dep_time %/% 100 * 60 + sched_dep_time %% 100
                  )
 ```

Another exercise I did was to compare `air_time` with `arr_time - dep_time`. I created a new variable `air_time_calc` to refer to ``arr_time` - `dep_time``.

```R
flights <- mutate(flights,
                  air_time_calc = arr_time - dep_time
                  )
```

Looking at the first 10 rows, the two fields (`air_time_calc` and `air_time`) have different values. I thought the difference was because `arr_time` and `dep_time` are in HHMM format while `air_time` was in minutes. So I used `mutate()` to transform `arr_time` and `dep_time` to minutes.

```R
flights <- mutate(flights,
                  arr_time_min = arr_time %/% 100 * 60 + arr_time %% 100, #arrival time in minutes
                  dep_time_min = dep_time %/% 100 * 60 + dep_time %% 100, #departure time in minutes
                  air_time_calc1 = arr_time_min - dep_time_min #creating new air_time_calc field
                  )
```

Looking at the first 10 rows, the two fields their values are still different. The problem might be due to 
  1. Data errors 
  2. The flights passed midnight 
  3. Airports in different timezones

To check the first problem, I turned to the documentation and found out I did not miss anything. So I did a little research about the errors and found that it may be because of unaccounted time for taxiing, landing, and takeoff. This time which can vary significantly might explain why `air_time_calc1` is greater than `air_time` in most of the cases because the `arr_time` and `dep_time` include time for taxiing, landing, and takeoff. [Click here for more information](https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/107373/is-departure-time-when-the-plane-leaves-the-gate-or-when-it-takes-off)

On the second problem, if the flight passed midnight, there could be a 1,440 minutes difference (24 hours). I used `filter()` to check this and found 5 flights with with this problem. I used the following code:

```R
flightsPassedMid <- flights %>% 
  filter(abs(air_time_calc1 - air_time) == 1440) #checking the absolute value of the difference
head(flightsPassedMid)
```

So what about the other flights? Can the final reason explain this? To get a clear picture of the problem, I printed a sample data of `air_time` and `air_time_calc1` fields together with `origin` and `dest` fields.

```R
sampleRows <- sample(nrow(flights), 20)  # Select 20 random rows
selectedCols <- c("origin", "dest","air_time", "air_time_calc1")  # Columns of interest
sampleData <- flights[sampleRows, selectedCols]
print(sampleData)
````

Then, I used `mutate()` to add a field for the differences between `air_time_calc1` and `air_time`


```R
sampleData <- mutate(sampleData, 
                     air_time_diff = air_time_calc1 - air_time
                     )
```
I hypothesized that flights between airports that are in different timezones might have `air_time_calc1` less than `air_time`. To prove my hypothesis, I used the `airports` data frame (part of `nycflights13` package). In the `airports` data frame, I selected the FAA airport code (`faa`). timezone (`tz`) and Daylight savings time zone (`dst`) for `origin` column. (Refer to the documentation for more information about the variables.)

```R
airports_selected_origin <- select(airports, faa, tz_origin = tz, dst_origin = dst)

airports_selected_dest <- select(airports, faa, tz_dest = tz, dst_dest = dst)
````

I then merged the selected columns based on a common key for origin and dest as shown below:

```R
merged_data <- left_join(sampleData, airports_selected_origin, by = c("origin" = "faa"))

merged_data <- left_join(merged_data, airports_selected_dest, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

# View the merged data frame
view(merged_data)
````
#### Conclusion
I found that flights between airports that are in different timezones have `air_time_calc1` that is less than `air_time` (negative `air_time_diff`). So it is possible that the three reasons have something to do with `air_time` not being equal to `arr_time - dep_time`

I went on with practicing using `mutate` in analysis by comparing `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, and `dep_delay` variables in the flights dataset. I wanted to understand how these three numbers were related and identify any discrepancies.

To begin, I used the `mutate()` function to create a new variable named `dep_delay_calc` in the `flights` dataset. This variable represented the calculated departure delay by subtracting `sched_dep_time` from `dep_time`. I then used the `select()` function to extract the relevant variables, including `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, `dep_delay`, and `dep_delay_calc`, into a new data frame called `flightsDelay`.

However, I discovered an issue with `dep_delay` when delays spilled over to the next hour. The error arose because `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` were in HHMM format. To address this, I decided to transform `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` into minutes from midnight. I accomplished this by creating two new variables, `dep_time_min` and `sched_dep_time_min`, using the `mutate()` function. These new variables converted the time values to minutes by dividing the hour part (`%/% 100`) by 60 and adding the minute part (`%% 100`).

After these transformations, the difference between `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` in minutes became equivalent to `dep_delay_calc`, rectifying the earlier discrepancy. In cases where the delay extended past midnight, the difference increased by 1440 minutes (equivalent to 24 hours or 1 day).

Next, I tackled the task of finding the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. However, I needed to decide how to handle ties. For this analysis, I utilized the `min_rank()` function to rank the flights by their departure delay in descending order, assigning the same rank to tied values.

## Grouping summaries using the `summarize()` function.

I explored group summaries using the `summarize()` function by calculating the average departure delay across all flights using the `flights` dataset and stored it in a summary variable called `delay`.

```R
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

To further investigate the average delay per day, I used the `group_by()` function to group the flights by the `dest` variable. I then used the `summarize()` function to calculate the mean departure delay per destination and stored the results in a new data frame called `delPerDestSum`.

```R
delPerDest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delPerDestSum <- summarise(delPerDest, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Additionally, I sought to examine the relationship between the distance of a flight and its delays. I grouped the flights by destination (`dest`) using the `group_by()` function. Then, I calculated the count, average arrival delay (`delay`), and average distance (`distance`) for each destination using the `summarize()` function. To ensure meaningful analysis, I filtered out destinations with a count less than or equal to 20 and excluded the destination "HNL".

```R
dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
destSum <- summarize(dest,
                     count = n(),
                     delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
                     distance = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE))
destSum <- filter(destSum,  count>20, dest != "HNL")
ggplot(data = destSum, mapping = aes(x = distance, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = distance), alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
destSum <- filter(destSum, count>20)
```

To visually represent the relationship between distance and delay, I created a scatter plot using the `ggplot()` function. The plot depicted the average distance on the x-axis and the average delay on the y-axis. The size of the points was proportional to the distance, and the transparency was set to 0.2 to avoid overplotting. Additionally, I included a smoothed line (without standard error bars) to illustrate any potential trends.

For code simplification, I implemented a concise version of the previous analysis using the `%>%` operator and the dplyr package's pipe syntax. The resulting data frame, `destSum2`, stored the summarized information about each destination's count, average delay, and average distance. I applied the same filtering criteria as before to ensure meaningful results.

```R
destSum2 <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    distance = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
  ```

Including `na.rm = TRUE` every time in the code is kind of tiring. So I looked for a way to avoid it. So, I started by removing the missing values in the data to avoid using `na.rm = TRUE` later on. The code snippet used is as follows:

```R
notCancelled <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
```

Here, I created a new dataset `notCancelled` by filtering out rows where both `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` are not missing (`!is.na(dep_delay)` and `!is.na(arr_delay)`). So I don't have to use `na.rm = TRUE` ever time I want to exclude missing flights in the summary.

### Weighting Counts

Next, I learned about weighting counts by assigning weights to observations based on a specific variable. The code example demonstrates this concept:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)
```

In the above code, I used the `count()` function to calculate the sum of the `distance` values for each unique `tailnum`. The `wt` parameter is used to assign weights to each observation, giving more weight to observations with larger distances.

### Summarizing Observations with Logic

I explored summarizing observations based on certain criteria using logical conditions. The code snippets provided demonstrate two approaches:

1. In the first instance, I grouped the flights based on year, month, and day and then used `sum()` to count the number of early flights i.e flights that departed before 5am:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(nEarlyFlights = sum(dep_time < 500))
```

2. In the second instance, I used `mean()` to calculate the proportion of the early flights:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(percEarlyFlights = mean(dep_time < 500))
```

### Summarizing Grouped Data with Descriptive Statistics

I further explored summarization techniques using descriptive statistics. The code examples illustrate different approaches:

1. Calculating the mean delay and count of flights for each destination:

```R
earlyflights <- notCancelled %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay < 0], na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

Here, I grouped the data by `dest` and calculate the count of flights and the mean delay for flights with negative arrival delays (`arr_delay < 0`).

2. Counting the number of distinct carriers for each destination:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    carriers = n_distinct(carrier)
  )
```

I grouped the data by `dest` and calculate the count of flights and the number of distinct carriers using the `n_distinct()` function.

3. Computing the standard deviation of distances for each destination:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    distance_sd = sd(distance)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(distance_sd))
```

In the third instance, I grouped the data by `dest` and calculate the standard deviation of distances using the `sd()` function. The results are then arranged in descending order of the standard deviation.

### Summarizing Time-related Information

Next, I focused on summarizing time-related information using different techniques.

1. Finding the departure time of the first flight and last flight each day using `min()` and `max()`:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(
    firstFlight = min(dep_time),
    lastFlight = max(dep_time)
  )
```

I grouped the data by `year`, `month`, and `day` and calculated the minimum and maximum departure time to determine the first and last flights each day.

2. I also learned of an an alternatively way of finding the first and last departure time using `first()` and `last()` functions  respectively:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(
    firstFlight1 = first(dep_time),
    lastFlight1 = last(dep_time)
  )
```

In this approach, I utilized the `first()` and `last()` functions to directly obtain the departure time of the first and last flights each day.

3. I learned the usefulness of using the `nth()` function to find the departure time of the nth flight, say the fifth flight, tenth flight, or the fifth flight from the last one:

```R
notCancelled %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(
    fifthFlight = nth(dep_time, 5),
    tenthFlight = nth(dep_time, 10),
    fifthLastFlight = nth(dep_time, -5)
  )
```

In the above example, I groupd the data by `year`, `month`, and `day` and use the `nth()` function to extract the departure time of the fifth flight, tenth flight, and fifth-to-last flight.

### Grouping Variables by Multiple Variables and Summarizing

Lastly, I learned how to group data by multiple variables and summarizing them at different levels (day, month, and year).

```R
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
(per_day <- summarize(daily, flights = n()))
(per_month <- summarize(per_day, flights = sum(flights)))
(per_year <- summarize(per_month, flights = sum(flights)))
```

I created a `daily` object by grouping the data by `year`, `month`, and `day`. Then, we summarize the grouped data to calculate the number of flights per day, per month, and per year.

This concludes the documentation for the R code, covering various data manipulation and summarization techniques. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!

By performing these analyses and exploring the relationships among departure time, scheduled departure time, and departure delay, I gained valuable insights into flight delays. These findings provide a foundation for further investigation and decision-making in the realm of flight data analysis.
